# MFFNet-to-detect-fatigue-sEMG_
##The purpose of the experiment
The main content of this warehouse comes from a work in our laboratory: using multi-dimensional feature fusion network to analyze sEMG data and detect muscle fatigue.

##Dependent environment
* torch --1.1.0
* numpy --1.17
* tenSorboard --1.7
* cuda --10.0
* torchsummary --1.5.1

## File introduce

* tools.py: Custom loss functionã€‚
* DataHelper.py: load train data and test data: numpy->torch.tensor
* Note: Other documents(include model file) will be announced after the paper is published.

## Datasets
* Dataset1: is the data of our laboratory, if you need it, you can contact us by email:[address](1351146953@qq.com).
Of course, it will be provided after the paper is published.
* Dataset2: is provided by Michalis et al[1]. and can be obtained through the contact 
method provided in the paper.
